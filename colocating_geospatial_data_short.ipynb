    "# Colocating geospatial data with Xarray\n",
    "A common problem in Earth sciences is to colocate data from different sources, for example, colocate output from a numerical ocean model with profiles from Argo floats or satellite measurements with a meteorological stations. These data might also be distributed with different spatial and temporal resolutions, making it challenging to intercompare variables. In this lecture, we will learn how to colocate different datasets in Python using the `xarray` library.\n",

    "### Scenario\n",
    "You are working on an air-sea interaction project and would like to investigate trends in **surface air temperature** in the northeast Pacific. You choose to start your analysis with NOAA's [National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.surface.html); however, you have never worked with this product before, and you would like to check how it compares with *in situ* observations, such as buoys and moorings from the [National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) (NDBC). Your final goal is to produce a time series plot of air temperature from the NCEP global reanalysis at the closest point to a given ocean/weather station.\n",
